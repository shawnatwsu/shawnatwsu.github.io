## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m <b>Shawn Preston</b> â€” a climate, remote sensing, and GIS scientist with an M.S. in Environmental Science and a passion for leveraging data, maps, and satellite imagery to understand our changing planet. Iâ€™ve worked across diverse projects at <b>NASA, NOAA, USGS, and Washington State University</b>, analyzing everything from extreme heat and stormwater events to wildfire progression and agricultural resilience.



## ðŸš€ My Toolkit

- Computational Analysis: Python (xarray, matplotlib, cartopy, pandas, statsmodels), NCL, CDO, R, HPC pipelines, and version-controlled workflows.
- Geospatial Science: ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Cartopy, Google Earth Engine, and large-scale model outputs like CESM2-LE.
- Fieldwork: Soil sampling on Mount St. Helens, ecological surveys, and in-situ measurements.

I thrive on tackling big datasets, building interactive visualizations, and translating complex findings into clear, actionable insights. Whether itâ€™s mapping climate attribution, quantifying hazard impacts, or crafting story-driven narratives, Iâ€™m driven by the intersection of science and solutions.

Now that Iâ€™ve wrapped up my graduate work, Iâ€™m eager to collaborate with climate tech innovators, environmental organizations, and fellow researchers. Letâ€™s connect and build something meaningful.

### Changing climate risks for high-value tree fruit production across the United States  
**Authors:** Preston, S., Rajagopalan, K., Yourek, M., Kalcsits, L., & Singh, D.  
**Journal:** Environmental Research Letters, 2024, [Link to Paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad90f4/meta)
**[Repository Link](https://github.com/shawnatwsu/Changing-Climate-Risks-for-High-Value-Tree-Fruit-Production-across-the-United-States)**

**Summary:**  
This publication evaluates how shifting temperature metricsâ€”such as growing degree days, chill portions, and extreme thresholdsâ€”influence the viability of apple production across the U.S. By integrating observational data and climate model projections, the work highlights regions most at risk from warming trends, offering valuable insights for growers, policymakers, and researchers focused on agricultural resilience and sustainability.

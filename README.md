## About Me

Hi, I’m Shawn — a recent Environmental Science master’s graduate with a passion for using data, maps, and satellite imagery to understand our changing planet. I’ve worked with tools like Python, GIS, and remote sensing platforms to analyze climate impacts, from extreme heat to agricultural shifts. My background blends field experience (soil sampling at Mt. St. Helens) with computational work (building scripts and visualizations using climate models and observational data).

Over the last few years, I’ve had the chance to contribute to research at NASA, NOAA, and Washington State University, working on projects that range from natural hazards to food resilience. I enjoy digging into big datasets, learning new tools, and collaborating with others who care about climate, science, and solutions.

Now that I’ve wrapped up my graduate work, I’m looking to connect with others in the environmental science, climate tech, or geospatial space — whether it’s for a project, mentorship, or job opportunities. Let’s build something meaningful.

## Publications

### Changing climate risks for high-value tree fruit production across the United States  
**Authors:** Preston, S., Rajagopalan, K., Yourek, M., Kalcsits, L., & Singh, D.  
**Journal:** Environmental Research Letters, 2024, [Link to Paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad90f4/meta)
**[Repository Link](https://github.com/shawnatwsu/Changing-Climate-Risks-for-High-Value-Tree-Fruit-Production-across-the-United-States)**

**Summary:**  
This publication evaluates how shifting temperature metrics—such as growing degree days, chill portions, and extreme thresholds—influence the viability of apple production across the U.S. By integrating observational data and climate model projections, the work highlights regions most at risk from warming trends, offering valuable insights for growers, policymakers, and researchers focused on agricultural resilience and sustainability.
